  <h1>Experiment debrief</h1>
  <p>Thank you for taking part in our experiment! If you have any questions, please email Alan Nielsen <a href='mailto:alan.nielsen@mpi.nl' target = '_top'>alan.nielsen@mpi.nl</a>.
  </p>
  <p>The following explains a bit about the rationale behind the experiment.
  </p>
  <p>Human beings have a curious tendency to associate separate perceptual domains in ways that overlap between participants. For example, while participating in this experiment you may have felt that some associations were very natural. You might, for example, have felt natural associating high pitched sounds with bright colors, small things, or fast-moving visual images. If so, you represent a typical and well-described response to this sort of question. In the past century a great deal of research has been done enumerating the countless associations made by normal members of the population.
  </p>
  <p>At the same time as some associations felt natural or 'right' to you while participating in this experiment, others may have felt more natural based on cultural conventions. For example you might have associated bright yellow with Happiness and other positive emotions. Researchers do not currently know whether these types of associations are natural or are learned. The color red is associated with anger in western culture, but is this a convention we have agreed upon or a natural one? Finally, making choices on a number of other associations may have seemed strange or difficult. Are large circles stressed or calm relative to small circles? Is a high-pitched sound more like a red circle or a yellow circle?
  </p>
  <p>The purpose of this research is, using a large set of experimental participants and a set of standardized stimuli, to attempt to answer some of these questions.
    <ul>
      <li>What is the strength of different crossmodal associations?
      <li>Are some shared by nearly everyone while others are more idiosyncratic?
      <li>Does the number of times you are asked to associate a certain color with other stimuli have an effect on what kinds of judgements you make?
      <li>Are men and women different in the types of associations that they make?
    </ul>
