We are going to run a linear mixed effects model now. But first, let's make sure we have the required libraries and data (from the correct source) loaded:

```{}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
library(plyr)
library(doBy)
library(scales)
library(lme4)

setwd("/Users/ashleymicklos/Documents/GitHub/STE-PHEN/summer_school_sessions/10_data_prep")

cleandata=read.csv("cleandata.csv")
```

Ok, so we have the data file loaded. We need to fix it up just a little bit. 

First, we are going to change the response column to make values for correctness. Then aggregate the data. 

```{r Preparing Dataframe for Correctness Analysis}
# Getting rid of numerical response column that we aren't using
CorrData <- subset(cleandata, select = -c(Response))

# Melting data
CorrData <- melt(CorrData,
                 variable.name = "Prediction",
                 id.vars = c("DataSet", "Subject", "Condition", "TrialNum", "Inducer",
                             "Concurrent", "Comparison"))

# Aggregating Data

CorrDataAgg <- aggregate(value ~ Prediction + Subject + Condition + Inducer + Concurrent + Comparison,
                         CorrData, mean)

```

Now we can run some models!
